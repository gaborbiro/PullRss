# UpWork-Rss-Feed

I've been using this little app to get notified about new UpWork projects. Find it very usefull/better than the official UpWork app.

Allows quick triaging/favorite-ing. 

Requires rss feed link from your UpWork profile, but currently my own rss link is hardcoded. Let me know if you're interested in using the app with your own rss filter.
